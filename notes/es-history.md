*NOTE: ECMAScript is nothing more but Standardized JavaScript.*

## May 1995 - JavaScript is born

- Brendan Eich (then employee at Netscape) creates JavaScript prototype within 10 days
- The language was to be included in Netscape Navigator
- But Java was already included in Navigator: Why do we need another scripting language?
- The purpose was a "Glue Language" for the Navigator browser, an "easier-language" to be used by designers
- Netscape management had decided that the scripting language had to have a syntax similar to Java
- The original codename was *Mocha* (coined by Marc Andreesen)
- Netscape management changed it to *LiveScript*, for trademark and marketing reasons
- Later, Java was gaining momentum, and it was again renamed as *JavaScript*, for marketing reasons

## 1997 - ECMAScript 1

- In 1996, Netscape submitted the language for standardization to ECMA International
- Because of trademark issues with the term 'Java', it was renamed *ECMAScript*
- *JavaScript* became the most popular implementation of *ECMAScript Standard*
- Other implementations include: *JScript* (Microsoft) and *ActionScript* (Macromedia/Adobe)

## 1998 - ECMAScript 2

- Brought some modifications to conform to the ISO/IEC international standard

## 1999 - ECMAScript 3

- This was the first major widely-adopted release of the Standrized JavaScript
- ECMAScript 3 became the baseline for modern day JavaScript

## 2000 - ECMAScript 4 (Started and abandoned)

- TC-39 released a large, massive draft for ECMAScript 4, based after ActionScript 3
- It was massive in scope, way too massive:
- Updated features included
  - new syntax,
  - modules,
  - classes,
  - classical inheritance,
  - private object members,
  - optional type annotations, and more...
- The consensus was that these features would be too much to handle in one go
- Mozilla, Adobe, Macromedia continued work on ECMAScript 4
- Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft agreed on ECMAScript 3.1 instead, with a slow incremental-integration
- ECMAScript 3.1 introduced very few syntax changes
- While all of this was happening, the open source and developer communities set to work

## 2005 - AJAX was introduced

- JavaScript was the backbone
- This resulted in a renaissance period of JavaScript usage spearheaded by open source libraries
- All attempt to reconcile ECMAScript 3.1 and ECMAScript 4 failed

## 2008 - Two Camps

- Brendan Eich (creator of JS) announced that TC-39 would focus its efforts on 
  standardizing ECMAScript 3.1 and a Harmony should be created between the two camps

## 2009 - ECMAScript 5

- Standardized and publicized from the efforts put into ECMAScript 3.1
- ECMAScript 4 was skipped altogether to avoid confusion
- ECMAScript 5 is the version of ECMAScript that all browsers fully support today
- It brings several enhancements to the standard library and updated language semantics via a `strict mode`

## 2011 - ECMAScript 5.1

- ES5 was submitted as an ISO standard
- In the process, minor corrections were made, and ES5.1 contains those corrections
- ECMAScript 5.1 is the same text as ISO/IEC 16262:2011

## 2015 - ECMAScript 6

- This version went through several changes:
  - **ECMAScript Harmony**:
    - It was the initial codename for JavaScript improvements efforts after ECMAScript 5
    - It was to harmonized the rift that happened between the ES3.1 and ES4 camps
  - **ECMAScript Next**:
    - It became apparent that the plans for Harmony were too ambitious for a single version, so its features were split into two groups.
    - The first group of features had highest priority and was to become the *Next* version after ES5.
    - The code name of that version was `ECMAScript Next` to avoid prematurely committing to a version number (which proved to be problematic as with ES4.)
    - The second group of features had time until after ECMAScript Next.
  - **ECMAScript 6**:
    - As *ECMAScript Next* matured, its codename was dropped and the community started to call it *ECMAScript 6*.
  - **ECMAScript 2015**:
    - In late 2014, TC-39 decided to change the official name of ECMAScript 6 to ECMAScript 2015, because it was decided that ECMAScript will get yearly spec releases
    - However, given how established the name `ES6` already was and how late TC-39 changed their minds, it was expected that ES6 is now how everybody will continue to refer to that version

## 2016 - ECMAScript 2016
  
- It was previously called ECMAScript 7
- Starting with ES2016, the language standard will see smaller yearly releases.
- The concept adopted for each release is **One JavaScript**, which means any successive releases should never break previous releases

## 2017 - ECMAScript 2017

- Yearly release

## 2018 - ECMAScript 2018

- Yearly release
