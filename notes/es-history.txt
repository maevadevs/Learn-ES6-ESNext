ECMAScript: 5 -> 5.1 -> Harmony -> Next -> 2015(6) -> 2016(7)

ECMAScript 5 (Released December 2009)
  This is the version of ECMAScript that most browsers support today.
  It brings several enhancements to the standard library and updated
  language semantics via a strict mode.

ECMAScript 5.1 (June 2011)
  ES5 was submitted as an ISO standard.
  In the process, minor corrections were made.
  ES5.1 contains those corrections.
  It is the same text as ISO/IEC 16262:2011.

ECMAScript 6 (June 2015)
  This version went through several changes:

  - ECMAScript Harmony:
    It was the initial code name for JavaScript improvements after ECMAScript 5.

  - ECMAScript Next:
    It became apparent that the plans for Harmony were too ambitious for a
    single version, so its features were split into two groups.
    The first group of features had highest priority and was to become the next
    version after ES5. The code name of that version was ECMAScript Next to
    avoid prematurely committing to a version number (which proved problematic
    with ES4.) The second group of features had time until after ECMAScript Next.

  - ECMAScript 6:
    As ECMAScript Next matured, its codename was dropped and everybody started
    to call it ECMAScript 6.

  - ECMAScript 2015:
    In late 2014, TC39 decided to change the official name of ECMAScript 6 to
    ECMAScript 2015, in light of upcoming yearly spec releases.
    However, given how established the name “ECMAScript 6” already is and how
    late TC39 changed their minds, it is expected that ES6 is how everybody will
    continue to refer to that version.

  - ECMAScript 2016:
    It was previously called ECMAScript 7.
    Starting with ES2016, the language standard will see smaller yearly releases.
